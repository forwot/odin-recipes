    <p>This is the recipe you’ve been waiting for, where everything is made from scratch, with love, from the paste to the broth to the sambal. It may look like a lot to take in, but none of the steps themselves are tricky once you get down to it – it just takes a while. Settle in for the afternoon and enjoy a spot of cooking therapy. It’s worth it.</p>

    <ul>

        <li>reserved shells and heads from the prawns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chilli Sambal</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup large dried red chilies</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dried shrimp</li>
        <li>2 tsp belacan (Malaysian shrimp paste)</li>

        <li>2 tsp, firmly packed, shaved palm sugar</li>
        <li>60ml (¼ cup) vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps to Cook</h1>
    <h3>Prepare the Spice Paste</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the dried chillies with boiling water and soak for 30 minutes until softened. In a separate bowl, soak the
            dried shrimp in hot water for 20 minutes; drain, squeeze out excess water, and roughly chop.</li>
        <li>Once the chillies are soft, squeeze out the water (reserve the liquid), roughly chop, and add to a blender with
            the shrimp.</li>
        <li>Wrap the belacan in foil and dry-fry in a heavy-based pan over medium heat for 2-3 minutes per side until
            fragrant. Add to the blender.</li>
        <li>Dry-roast coriander seeds in a pan for 3 minutes until fragrant, then grind into a fine powder. Add to the
            blender along with shallots, galangal, ginger, garlic, lemongrass, and macadamias.</li>
        <li>Process the mixture into a paste, adding a little reserved chilli-soaking liquid if needed. Stir in the turmeric
            by hand to avoid staining the blender.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Make the Chilli Sambal</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak dried chillies and dried shrimp in separate bowls of boiling water for 30 minutes. Dry-fry foil-wrapped
            belacan for 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Drain and de-seed both the soaked and fresh chillies, then roughly chop. Drain and chop the dried shrimp.</li>
        <li>Place chillies, shrimp, belacan, shallot, garlic, palm sugar, 1½ tbsp water, and 1 tbsp oil in a food processor
            and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in a wok over low-medium heat. Cook the paste, stirring constantly, for about 15 minutes
            or until the oil separates. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Prepare the Prawn Stock</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook prawn heads and shells for 10 minutes until they smell
            toasty and liquid has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Add 2 litres of water and bring to a simmer. Cook for 40 minutes, skimming any scum from the surface.</li>
        <li>Strain the stock, pressing the solids to extract flavor. Measure out 1.25 litres (top up with water if
            necessary).</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Assemble the Laksa</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the noodles. In a separate large saucepan, heat oil and fry the spice
            paste for 4-5 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the coconut milk and prawn stock. Add palm sugar, fish sauce, and salt. Simmer gently over low heat for
            15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles in the boiling water until tender. Drain, snip into short lengths with scissors, and divide
            into serving bowls.</li>
        <li>Using the noodle water, blanch the prawns for 4 minutes until cooked, then blanch the fish balls, beanshoots,
            and tofu puffs until warm. Add all to the bowls.</li>
        <li>Divide the cockles or clams among the bowls and ladle the hot laksa soup over the top.</li>
        <li>Garnish with Vietnamese mint and a dollop of chilli sambal. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
